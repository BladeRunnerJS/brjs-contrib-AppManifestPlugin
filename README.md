# App Manifest Plugin

## Function
A plugin for Caplin Systems's bladerunnerjs which creates a manifest file for the app conforming to these standards; https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Manifest

## Future
For now it uses a config file called manifest-config.txt, but in the future it's hoped that the config options will be inputable to app.conf
More tests should be added.
